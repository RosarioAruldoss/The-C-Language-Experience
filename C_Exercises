Hey, in here we are trying to do an exercise in which, we will be building a pyramid using the '#' bricks. For starters, the bricks can be aligned from left to right as that is considered easy.

we are trying to simplify the task in hand. Lets see if we can incorporate it with simple steps.

Step 1 : Get the input from the user for no of rows
Step 2 : Print bricks - '#' with one brick on row 1 till the no of bricks as the input from the user on the n'th row.
