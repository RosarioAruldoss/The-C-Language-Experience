Initially we are going through the pragrams that were practiced after scratch programming. 
With that in mind we are exploring the basic way how the source code we compile is converted to machine code, comupters could understand.
We named the file hello.c for easier compilation.

/*NO:1
//Hello world Program

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
}

With the command [clang hello.c] we are able to create a file a.out which is also able to give an output*/


/*
//NO:2
//Getting a string program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name?\n");
    printf("Hello %s, Do well. Congragulations!\n",name);
}
Its like a revision */



//Meow Program
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
void meow (void); //calling the function
int main (void)
#define times 3 //using the define function for the first time
{
    for (int i=0;i<times;i++)
    meow();
}
void meow (void)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}
