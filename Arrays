Initially we are going through the pragrams that were practiced after scratch programming. 
With that in mind we are exploring the basic way how the source code we compile is converted to machine code, comupters could understand.
We named the file hello.c for easier compilation.

/*NO:1
//Hello world Program

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
}

With the command [clang hello.c] we are able to create a file a.out which is also able to give an output*/


/*
//NO:2
//Getting a string program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name?\n");
    printf("Hello %s, Do well. Congragulations!\n",name);
}
Its like a revision */



//Meow Program
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
void meow (void); //calling the function
int main (void)
#define times 3 //using the define function for the first time
{
    for (int i=0;i<times;i++)
    meow();
}
void meow (void)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}

Basically the steps involved are 
1. Preprocessing
2. Compiling
3. Assembly
4. Linking


The debugging :

    It is said that the term debugging came from the Harvard Mark 1 computer. There was a bug- a moth inside the computer that was sabotaging the computer's
operations. The person who built the computer found the moth and pasted the moth in his notebook leading to the origin of the word - debugging.
    One of the debuggers we are gonna use is debug50. In addition, we cannot use the printf statement very frequently. When used frequently, it may lead to errors.

    In this case we can use the debug50 ./debug and run. Some random things will happen and you will be able to see what the program does with the help of the step over at the top and 
pause option by the left - a red dot. By doing a step by step debugging we will be able to identify the error.

for example:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void print_height(int height);
int main(void)
{
    int h = get_int("Height : ");
    print_height(h);
}

void print_height(int height)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <= height; i++)
    {
        printf("#\n");
    }
}

/*
used to practice how to use the debugger
debug50 ./bug
mark the pause.
use stepover
use play
we can observe the path at the human pace.
*/



Memory Allocation

All the 0s and 1s with the respective addresses are stored in the computer's hardware.

> CLANG:
        Clang is a program that runs in the background. make command makes the source code to be processed in the background.
        > terminal command: clang -o hello hello.c  : Clang output hello while compiling hello.c
        > terminal command: clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50: when running a program directly with the Clang compiler, it doesn't know how to use the library. 
                                                             So, we have to specify the compiler to the library by mentioning it.

/*This is the first program in Arrays
we are to enter the scores of 3 subjects*/

/*

>> Printing average of scores: <<

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score1 = 80;
    int score2 = 70;
    int score3 = 90;
//now let's try to print the average.
    printf("average: %i\n",(score1 + score2 + score3)/3);
}
*/
/*
>> Printing average of scores with float: <<

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main (void)
{
    int score1 = 80;
    int score2 = 70;
    int score3 = 90;
//  printf("average: %f\n",(score1 + score2 + score3)/3.0); //let's use float this time. As the
scores are int, it will show an error printf("average: %f\n",(score1 + score2 + score3)/(float)3.0);
//(is an alternate option). In order to overcome that we make 3 - 3.0
}
Instead of assigning data type for each and every score, what if we could just do it one and it will
generate that many number Arrays can be made use in this case

An array is a sequence of numbers back to back in memory.
