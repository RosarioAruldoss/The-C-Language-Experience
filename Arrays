Initially we are going through the pragrams that were practiced after scratch programming. 
With that in mind we are exploring the basic way how the source code we compile is converted to machine code, comupters could understand.
We named the file hello.c for easier compilation.

/*NO:1
//Hello world Program

#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
}

With the command [clang hello.c] we are able to create a file a.out which is also able to give an output*/


/*
//NO:2
//Getting a string program.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
int main (void)
{
    string name = get_string("What is your name?\n");
    printf("Hello %s, Do well. Congragulations!\n",name);
}
Its like a revision */



//Meow Program
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>
void meow (void); //calling the function
int main (void)
#define times 3 //using the define function for the first time
{
    for (int i=0;i<times;i++)
    meow();
}
void meow (void)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}

Basically the steps involved are 
1. Preprocessing
2. Compiling
3. Assembly
4. Linking


The debugging :

    It is said that the term debugging came from the Harvard Mark 1 computer. There was a bug- a moth inside the computer that was sabotaging the computer's
operations. The person who built the computer found the moth and pasted the moth in his notebook leading to the origin of the word - debugging.
    One of the debuggers we are gonna use is debug50. In addition, we cannot use the printf statement very frequently. When used frequently, it may lead to errors.

    In this case we can use the debug50 ./debug and run. Some random things will happen and you will be able to see what the program does with the help of the step over at the top and 
pause option by the left - a red dot. By doing a step by step debugging we will be able to identify the error.

for example:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void print_height(int height);
int main(void)
{
    int h = get_int("Height : ");
    print_height(h);
}

void print_height(int height)
{
    for (int i = 0; i <= height; i++)
    {
        printf("#\n");
    }
}

/*
used to practice how to use the debugger
debug50 ./bug
mark the pause.
use stepover
use play
we can observe the path at the human pace.
